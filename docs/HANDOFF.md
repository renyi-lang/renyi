# Handoff

Last updated: 2026-10-06, session 6 (the VM: `renyi run` and `renyi test`;
the primitive boundary: `renyi record`, `run --replay`, `--explain`,
`replays` tests, budgets and scope checks; the HTTP client, the HTTP
server and SQLite; the grant stack). Branch: `main` is the only branch
(owner's decision, 2026-10-05); commit and push there directly.

## Where the project stands

Milestones M0 (design), M1 (front end) and M2 (type and effect checker) are
done; the project map (`renyi index`, decision O2) exists with its budget
report (`--budgets`, decisions O3 and R7); M3 (the VM) runs programs with
every module of the standard library and implements decisions P1 and P2
(recorded runs, budgets, the grant stack of Q1) at its primitive boundary;
what M3 still lacks is the run manifest of decision Q2 (tasks run one
after the other by decision S2). Design decisions are in sections 0 to S
of `01-decisions.md`;
the agent tooling in `05-agent-tooling.md`, the signature capabilities in
`06-runtime-guarantees.md`, the system-level commitments in
`07-system-design.md`. The corpus has 30 programs, passes the lint, is in
canonical layout, checks cleanly, has nothing over budget, and its 85
`example:` lines and `test` blocks pass on the VM (three are `replays`
tests answered from recordings under `examples/fixtures/`). The cheat sheet
measures 2977 of 3000 tokens (unchanged this session). The Rust workspace
has five crates: `renyi_syntax`, `renyi_check`, `renyi_index`, `renyi_vm`
and the `renyi` binary with `check`, `format`, `tokens`, `parse [--json]`,
`index [--json | --budgets]`, `run [options] <file> [arguments]`, `record
[--to file] [options] <file> [arguments]`, `test [--strict] [--refresh
name] [--explain] <file>...` and `version`; 126 tests, clippy and fmt clean
on Windows. The VM depends on `ureq` (HTTP, with rustls) and `rusqlite`
(SQLite compiled in), decision S1.

The first live readability round (`tests/readability/2026-10-05-1623155/`)
stands as session 5 left it: Sonnet 5.5 passes Predict (90) and Explain
(97), misses Complete by one item (79) and Write by three (40); Haiku 4.5
and gpt-5.4-mini are below on all but Explain. Since decision R1 only the
large model of each vendor gates the freeze. The grammar is not frozen; the
owner's decisions R1 to R8 are applied; the cheat sheet changes of R3, R5
and R6 are unmeasured (round 2, below).

## The VM as it exists (`crates/renyi_vm`)

- **Pipeline.** `renyi run file.ry` reads the file and its imports,
  `check_project`s them (an error stops here, printed as `check` prints
  it), `compile_project` lowers every non-library body to bytecode, and
  `run_main` runs `main` with the command-line arguments. `renyi test`
  compiles the same way and runs every `example:` line and `test` block in
  source order, one line each, then `N passed, M failed[, K skipped]`;
  exit 1 when any fails. A failing `main` prints `main failed with <error>`
  (exit 1); a crash prints the message and `file:line` (exit 2);
  `environment.exit(code)` exits with the code.
- **Compiler** (`compile/`). One `Code` per function body, test, constant,
  `example:` line (one for the call, one for the expected value or the
  `fails with` pattern) and refinement condition. Names are never resolved
  by the compiler: it reads the references the checker recorded
  (`Target::Function`, `AbilityMethod`, `Constant`, `Type`, `Variant`,
  `Number` for the type of every numeric literal and of every `sum`,
  `Result` for a call whose result type only the context decides, such as
  `json.parse`). Locals are slots on the value stack; `set x to
  x.method(...)` loads the receiver with `LoadMove` when the arguments do
  not read `x`, so lists, maps and sets grow in place (decision O1).
- **Failures.** A fallible call that fails leaves a `Failure` value. The
  value of an `otherwise` and the subject of a `match` with
  `success`/`failure` arms are *handled regions* (`PushHandler` /
  `PopHandler`); a failure inside one unwinds the operand stack to the
  region's start and jumps to the handler, where the fallback outcome runs
  (`otherwise fail` passes the same failure on). Outside any region a
  failure is the result of an example or test, and a crash
  (`unhandled failure: ...`) in a function, which the checker should have
  prevented. Constructing a refined type runs its compiled conditions;
  one that does not hold gives `Failure(ConstraintViolation(type_name,
  detail))` with the condition's source text as the detail.
- **Values** (`value.rs`). `Integer` is `i64` with a `BigInt` spill
  (decision B9), `Decimal` an emulation of IEEE decimal128 (34 digits,
  round half even, exponent kept, so `9.50 + 5.00` prints `14.50`; division
  exact when it terminates, else rounded; decision J16, R5: equality by
  value), `Float` is `f64`. `maybe` is the value or `Nothing`. Records,
  variants, lists, maps and sets (insertion order, K9) are `Rc`; a subtype
  value (`Path`, `Permission`) is its base value. `Date` is the library's
  record, `Instant` and `Duration` are milliseconds.
- **Derived abilities** (`render.rs`). `ToText`: a declared `to_text` of
  the value's type (a user implementation or a library primitive such as
  `Date`'s) when there is one, else a variant as its bare name, a record in
  constructor form with nested text quoted, lists `[1, 2]`, maps `{k: v}`,
  sets `[a, b].to_set()`, `nothing`. `Compare`: a declared `compare`, else
  records by their `can Compare by` fields or every field, variants by
  position then fields; `Equal` and `Hash` are structural.
- **Natives** (`natives/`). All of the prelude; `std.console`,
  `std.environment`, `std.time` (civil-date arithmetic, ISO instants),
  `std.random` (xorshift, seeded from the clock), `std.filesystem`,
  `std.json` (own reader and writer; decoding by the context type with the
  derivation rules of `04-stdlib-sketch.md` section 7, `as` names and
  `Naming`; `Constraint` errors from refinements), `std.csv` (RFC 4180
  cells, rows with line numbers), `std.regex` and `Text.matches` on the
  `regex` crate; `std.http` (`natives/http.rs`) on `ureq` 3 with rustls:
  a 30-second limit per request, redirects followed one hop at a time with
  every host checked against the grant (`HostNotAllowed` for a hop outside
  it, at most ten hops), 303 and a redirected POST become GET, a non-2xx
  answer is `Status(url, status, body)`, duplicate headers joined with a
  comma; `std.sqlite` (`natives/sqlite.rs`) on `rusqlite` with SQLite
  compiled in: a `Connection` is a native value (`<connection PATH>` in
  text and in recordings; its path is the scope of every call on it),
  parameters bind by type (`Decimal` and an `Integer` past `i64` as text,
  `Boolean` as 0 or 1), `query` decodes each row into the record of the
  context type by column name (`as` names honoured) and fails with
  `Mismatch(column, expected, found)` when a cell does not fit the field
  or a row does not satisfy the record's refinement; `std.server`
  (`natives/server.rs`) hand-written over `std::net::TcpListener`:
  HTTP/1.1, one request at a time, `PortInUse` and `PermissionDenied`
  from `bind`, the handler called through `Vm::call_function` with a
  `Request` record (lower-cased header names, percent-decoded query), the
  answer sent with `content-length` and `connection: close`.
- **The primitive boundary** (`Vm::call_native`, `grant.rs`,
  `recording.rs`; `06-runtime-guarantees.md` sections 1, 2 and 4). A
  primitive with `needs` passes one function. Its *effect* is its declared
  capability plus the scope its argument names (the normalised path, the
  host of the URL, the variable). `begin_run` sets the run's grant: the
  `needs` of `main` or of the test, narrowed by `--deny` (which refuses to
  start when any function needs the capability), `--allow-host`,
  `--allow-read`, `--allow-write` (an ancestor such as `filesystem` is
  split into its children first), with one counter per `at most` budget,
  declared or added by `--at-most`. An effect outside the grant fails with
  `FileError.PermissionDenied` or `HttpError.HostNotAllowed`, past a budget
  with `OverBudget` (added to both error types this session), and crashes
  when the primitive cannot fail. Live, the call runs and is appended to
  the recording (`Call { capability, primitive, arguments by name,
  outcome success/failure, duration_ms, at_ms }`, JSON by the `ToJson`
  rules); replaying, the entry with the same primitive and arguments
  answers it (identical entries in sequence order), its outcome decoded by
  the declared result and error types (`FunctionMeta.returns`/`fails`; a
  type-parameter result uses the context type the checker now records for
  effectful primitives), nothing is written or sent, and a call the
  recording lacks crashes naming the call and the nearest recorded one.
  `--explain` narrates on stderr: `Purpose. (module.name, param: value)`
  on entry, `-> value` on exit, and each effect as `console "text"` or
  `capability name(args) -> result[, N ms]`, indented by call depth.
- **The grant stack** (decision Q1; `grant::within`, `Vm::frame_grant`).
  Every frame carries its effective grant: the enclosing frame's (the
  run's for `main` and for a test body), narrowed by the `needs` of the
  function the frame runs. On a line the needs mention, a granted
  capability takes the scope both allow (`filesystem.read("work")` inside
  a function declared `filesystem.read("work/data")` becomes the latter;
  a parent such as `filesystem` is split into its children first); a line
  the needs do not mention passes through, since the function can reach
  it only through a function value whose effects its caller covered (the
  sketch: effects of a function-typed parameter flow to the call site).
  `call_native` and the redirect check of `std.http` test the innermost
  frame's grant; a denial that crashes names the function whose `needs`
  narrowed the grant. The narrowed grant is remembered per function while
  the enclosing grant is the same `Rc`, so a function called in a loop
  intersects once (open item R7-4). Budgets stay the run's.
- **Not yet.** `run concurrently` and `concurrently` queries run their
  tasks one after the other by decision S2 (`within` sets a deadline that
  is checked between statements or items and fails with `TimedOut`);
  green threads would be an improvement within that decision, not a
  reversal. The run manifest and `renyi reproduce` of decision Q2 are not
  built.

## Done in session 6

1. **`crates/renyi_vm`** (about 8300 lines with tests): `bytecode.rs`,
   `value.rs`, `integer.rs`, `decimal.rs`, `types.rs`, `compile/{mod, expr,
   stmt, pattern, query}.rs`, `vm.rs`, `render.rs`, `natives/{mod, prelude,
   system, time, filesystem, json, csv, regex}.rs`, `runner.rs`;
   `tests/corpus.rs` runs the ten Predict programs of the readability
   manifest against `tests/readability/reference/*.out` (all ten match: the
   hand-derived references are confirmed), every `example:` and `test` of
   the corpus (82 items, all pass), and a failing and a crashing `main`.
2. **Checker changes the VM needed**, each recorded as a reference so the
   map is unaffected: `Target::Number(NumberKind)` on every numeric literal
   and on a `sum` query (the literal takes the type its context expects, so
   `Number(value: 4)` carries a Decimal); `Target::Result(Ty)` at a call
   whose return type mentions a type parameter no argument mentions
   (`json.parse`, `sqlite.query`), resolved at the end of the body;
   `Target::Variant`/`Target::Type` on variant patterns;
   `BodyLocation::Example` for the references of `example:` lines and
   `BodyLocation::Condition` for refinement conditions.
3. **Refinement conditions are now checked** (`check_type_conditions`): a
   subtype's `where value ...` and every field condition of a record or a
   variant is checked as a small body over the fields (previously they were
   not checked at all; a condition calling an unknown method passed). The
   corpus and the library needed no change; `rules.rs` has a test.
4. **`renyi run` and `renyi test`** in `crates/renyi/src/main.rs`.
5. `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and the status line of `06-runtime-guarantees.md`
   say what runs.
6. **The primitive boundary** (second commit of the session): `grant.rs`
   (effective grant, budget counters, `effect_of`, `parse_capability`,
   path and host normalisation), `recording.rs` (the format of section
   1.1 with `at_ms`, parsing, the replay's matching), `Vm::call_native`
   with the scope check, the budgets, recording, replay and narration;
   `runner.rs` runs `main` and each test under its own grant, loads a
   `replays` fixture beside the test's source file, `--strict` fails a
   test that leaves recorded calls unused, `--refresh NAME` re-records one
   test's fixture (`TestOutcome::Recorded`); the binary gained `record`,
   `--replay`, `--explain`, `--deny`, `--allow-host`, `--allow-read`,
   `--allow-write`, `--at-most`, `--strict`, `--refresh`.
   `tests/recording.rs` records and replays a run with console, time,
   random and filesystem effects, stops a replay at an edited entry,
   refuses a recording the grant does not cover, enforces `at most 2 per
   run` and a path scope, writes and replays a `replays` fixture offline,
   and checks the narration of a run. Checker: `records_result` also
   records the context type of an effectful library call whose result
   mentions a type parameter (`random.choice`), so a replay can decode it;
   `effects::scope_contains` is public. Library: `OverBudget` added to
   `FileError` and `HttpError` (sketch and `library/std`).
7. **The HTTP client, the HTTP server and SQLite** (third commit). The
   owner chose the dependencies (decision S1: `ureq` 3, `rusqlite` with
   SQLite compiled in, a hand-written server over `std::net`) and kept
   the tasks sequential (decision S2; sketch section 12 says so).
   `natives/{http, sqlite, server}.rs` as described above;
   `tests/network.rs` runs a server on a loopback port and a client
   against it in one process (`Options::serve_limit` stops the server
   after N requests), records and replays a SQLite program with the
   database deleted between the two runs, and checks a row outside a
   refinement. The checker records `Target::Otherwise { fallible }` at
   every `otherwise` and the compiler emits the new `Op::JumpIfFailure`
   for a fallible subject, so `otherwise` after a void fallible call
   (`server.serve(...) otherwise fail`) no longer mistakes the `Nothing`
   of success for an absent value (a bug the server test found).
   `renyi test --refresh` recorded live fixtures for `weather` (Berlin,
   14.0 C, wind 5.5 km/h), `currency_tool` (USD to EUR at 0.89254; the
   service moved from `frankfurter.app` to `api.frankfurter.dev` and the
   example follows) and `concurrent_fetch` (example.com, 577
   characters); the three `replays` tests pin those values and pass
   offline with `--strict`. `--at-most` now rejects a budget on a
   capability that takes none. `examples/README.md`, `README.md`,
   `CLAUDE.md`, the status line of `06-runtime-guarantees.md` and the
   crate doc of `renyi_vm` say so.
8. **The grant stack** (fourth commit): `grant::within` and
   `Vm::frame_grant` as described above; `tests/recording.rs` shows a
   helper declared `filesystem.read(".../data")` denied a file that
   `main` reads directly before and after the call, and the crash of a
   primitive that cannot fail naming the helper.

## Done in session 5 (condensed)

Branch consolidation into `main`; the Windows build (LF pinned by
`.gitattributes`); `renyi index` with metrics, content hashes and
`--budgets`; the first live readability round (harness fixes 1 to 9, 182
judged Complete and Write samples, 49 adjudicated Explain samples, the
results table above and the analysis in the round's `notes.md`); cheat
sheet clarifications (derived `ToText`, `purpose:`, `ignore`, `is` on
numbers); the `weight_steps` purpose line; decisions R1 to R8 applied (the
protocol gates on large models; J3 and M4 stand; `purpose:` stays; `is` on
numbers compares values of one type; `ignore` only on calls with effects,
the checker's `ignore-pure`; budgets 10 / 5 / 7; gpt-5.5 joins round 2);
`ce.toml` at the repository root (untracked, in `.git/info/exclude`) sets
CodeEraser's guard to `warn` because its 750-line budget refused appends to
`01-decisions.md` and `02-syntax-sketch.md` (owner's decision; recreate it
on a fresh clone).

## Owner actions pending

- None. Session 5 printed the values of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` into a tool result once (not committed); the owner said
  in session 6 that they handle the transcript and the keys themselves, so
  no session needs to raise it again.

## Done in sessions 1 to 4 (condensed)

- Session 1: ~50 design decisions in interactive batches (`01-decisions.md`
  sections 0 to I), the clause grammar and the three verbs, the cheat sheet
  with its token gate, the lint, 14 example programs, the readability
  protocol (`03-readability-test.md`), README and license.
- Session 2: the corpus grown to 30 programs; round-2 decisions J1 to J18;
  the library sketch (`04-stdlib-sketch.md`) with decisions K1 to K11; the
  readability harness with the file provider; M1 started: lexer, parser,
  formatter, `renyi check`, `tokens`, `parse`, corpus conformance tests.
- Sessions 3 and 4: the subagent pre-test (`2026-10-05-e41258c/`) and
  decisions M1 to M10 from it; `renyi parse --json`; the standard library
  as declaration files (`library/std/*.ry`, decisions N1 to N3); **M2,
  `crates/renyi_check`** (world, bodies with bidirectional inference,
  subtyping, implicit `maybe`, generics, abilities, refinements on literals,
  fallible calls, error unions, exhaustiveness, queries, scoped effects);
  decisions O1 to O5 (reference counting with in-place reuse; the project
  map; budgets; the semantic diff; `renyi mcp`), P1 to P4 (recorded runs
  and `replays` tests, budgets in grants, provenance guards, the reserved
  words `only`, `per`, `replays`) and Q1 to Q4 (capability-safe packages,
  reproducibility, in-process sandboxing, checked live update), each with
  its design document.

## Next steps

1. **The rest of M3**, in this order: (a) recordings for the programs that
   still have none: `pagination` and `assistant` call the fictional host
   `api.example.com` (and `assistant` sends `Authorization: Bearer` with
   the key from `CHAT_API_KEY`), so either hand-write their fixtures in
   the format of `06-runtime-guarantees.md` section 1.1 (redaction, R6-3,
   becomes concrete there) or point them at real services first;
   `inventory_db` opens `data/inventory.db`, which must be seeded before
   `renyi test --refresh` can record it; (b) the run manifest and `renyi
   reproduce` of decision Q2 (`07-system-design.md` section 3: toolchain
   version, content hash of `main`'s closure, grant, arguments, the
   environment variables read with hashes of their values, the recording,
   the outcome; `reproduce` replays and compares the output byte for
   byte), which the design places in M3; (c) decision L2: re-run the 182
   judged Complete and Write samples of the live round and the 40 of the
   pre-test on the VM and compare with the subagents' verdicts (the
   `judgement.json` files hold the verdicts; the VM now decides `is` on
   Decimals by value, R5); (d) open items R6-1 to R6-4 of
   `06-runtime-guarantees.md` (binary bodies, query narration, redaction,
   budgets as data), now that the network primitives make them concrete.
2. **Readability round 2** on the revised cheat sheet, with gpt-5.5 at its
   default temperature as the fourth model (R8) and the R1 gating; the
   protocol reverts a change that lowers a passing rate by more than five
   points. The round costs API calls; the VM can replace the subagent
   judges for Complete and Write once (c) above has shown it agrees with
   them.
3. **`renyi mcp`** (O5, `05-agent-tooling.md` section 7), then the semantic
   diff (O4), then M4 (provenance guards, package manager, budgets in the
   manifest) and M5 (embedding API, `serve --watch`, LSP) as before.

## Known gaps and risks

- **VM.** `break` or `continue` as the outcome of an `if` or `match`
  *expression* nested inside another expression leaves that expression's
  partial operands on the stack (statements and loop bodies are clean); no
  corpus program does this. `Equal` and `Hash` are always structural: a
  user implementation of either is not called (the sketch derives `Equal`
  for every data type; `Hash` implementations are not in the corpus). A
  value's `IsType` test for a builtin (`when failure(error: Text)`) is by
  kind. `random` is seeded from the clock; a run is reproducible through
  its recording only. `Float.to_text` is Rust's shortest round-trip form.
  `Text.matches` compiles its pattern at every call. Durations print as
  `1.5s` / `250ms` (no decision covers the format). A refinement condition
  on a library type (`Date`, `Port`) runs on construction but its
  references are not recorded (the checker does not walk library bodies);
  only literals and local names occur there today.
- **Boundary.** A scope denial of a primitive that cannot fail
  (`filesystem.exists`, `environment.get` under `environment("HOME")`)
  is a crash, since the module has no error to return. A budget on a
  parent (`filesystem at most 10 per run`) stays one counter, but
  `--allow-read` splitting the parent into children copies the budget
  spelling onto each child in the recording's `grant` header. The
  replay matches arguments by their JSON, so a `Float` argument that
  prints differently after a change in `float_text` would not match. A
  replayed `--explain` shows no durations. `renyi record` of a program
  that reads stdin records the lines read (`console.read_line`), as
  designed. The recording's `revision` is `git rev-parse --short HEAD` of
  the program's directory. The grant stack narrows scopes and nothing
  else: a capability kind a function does not declare passes through its
  frame, where only a function value it calls can use it; the static rule
  keeps everything else out.
- **Network, server, SQLite.** The server is single-threaded and answers
  one request at a time, binds `0.0.0.0`, speaks plain HTTP/1.1 without
  TLS, reads a head of at most 64 KiB and a body of at most 16 MiB, and
  has `Options::serve_limit` only so that a test can stop it. The client
  reads at most 10 MB of body (ureq's default; past it the call fails as
  `Unreachable` with ureq's message), follows at most ten redirects and
  sends ureq's own `User-Agent` (`ureq/<version>`). SQLite binds a
  `Decimal` parameter as text, so SQL that compares it with a REAL column
  compares text; the type mapping is exercised by `tests/network.rs`
  against a real database but by no corpus program (`inventory_db` has no
  recording). `renyi test --refresh` prints the fixture path with mixed
  separators on Windows (`examples\fixtures/weather.json`): the relative
  name is joined onto the source directory as given.
- **Checker.** First-generation (local inference, covariant type arguments,
  structural ability checks, capabilities checked at call sites only; no
  `example:` literal check, no `see also` check, no `deprecated` warnings,
  no unreachable-pattern detection). The `ignore-pure` rule counts a call
  with effects anywhere inside the ignored expression. The new condition
  bodies bind every field of the record or variant, which the sketch
  (section 4: "over the field name") does not promise; a condition that
  reads another field type-checks and runs.
- **Readability.** The live round's Explain grades rest on two grader
  models and 49 adjudications by Claude; Haiku's Explain sits at exactly 90.
  The Complete and Write verdicts come from subagents (L2) until step 1(e)
  re-runs them. Sonnet 5.5 cannot be sampled at temperature 0, so its rates
  carry more sampling noise. The grant clauses (`at most`, `only to`,
  `replays`) have not been through a round; no corpus program uses them.
- **Library.** The standard library sketch is a first draft from the
  corpus; the JSON derivation rules are exercised by the VM's decoder on
  the three recorded responses; the SQLite type mapping is exercised by one
  test and the HTTP defaults (the 30-second limit, redirect handling) by
  the three recordings and the loopback test only.
- 88 reserved words include common identifiers; the round measured their
  cost and the owner kept them (R2). `tools/lint_examples.py` is
  regex-based. Decision O1 rests on the value graph being acyclic.

## Owner preferences observed

- Wants principled reasoning, asked explicitly for a mathematical angle on
  syntax; accepts recommendations readily but counters with concrete
  alternatives (deriving comparisons from `is`; typed comparison for `is`
  on numbers; keeping J3 and M4 against the measured cost).
- Chat in Chinese; all artifacts in English.
- Prefers questions as interactive option batches of four, recommended
  option first, over prose; answers within minutes.
- Implementation is to be written mainly by Claude in sessions; the owner
  reviews. `main` is the only branch.
